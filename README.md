Copyright ¬© 2018 Teal Dulcet and Daniel Connelly

‚ù§Ô∏è Please visit [tealdulcet.com](https://www.tealdulcet.com/) to support these scripts and my other software development.

## Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)

üÜï Thanks to Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Colab) service, anyone with an internet connection can now contribute to GIMPS for üÜì, without downloading or installing anything! Please see our [google-colab](google-colab) directory for instructions.

### Prime95/MPrime

Downloads, sets up and runs [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/#download). Supports only x86 CPUs.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mprime.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

To run Prime95 for Stress/Torture Testing, see the [Testing and Benchmarking](https://github.com/tdulcet/Testing-and-Benchmarking-Scripts) scripts.

### CUDALucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [CUDALucas](https://sourceforge.net/p/cudalucas/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/cudalucas.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### Mlucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download1). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments. Supports x86 Intel and AMD and ARM CPUs, but only recommended for ARM CPUs, which [Prime95/MPrime](#prime95mprime) does not support. Prime95/MPrime is faster than Mlucas on x86 CPUs. Run: `wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Linux-System-Information/master/info.sh -qO - | bash -s` to output your system information, including CPU and architecture.
This script follows the recommended instructions on the [Mlucas README](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html) for each architecture and CPU.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mlucas.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### GpuOwl

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs the latest version of [GpuOwl](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl) for PRP tests, version 7.2-112 for PRP tests with combined P-1 and the [v6 branch](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl/tree/v6) for LL and standalone P-1 tests. Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments. Creates wrapper script to run the correct version of GpuOwl based on the next assignment. Supports Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs supporting OpenCL. Note that [GpuOwl uses C++20](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl#build) and thus requires at least the GNU C++ compiler 8. Run: `g++ --version` to output your version.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/gpuowl.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### PrimeNet

Automatically gets assignments, reports assignment results, upload proof files and optionally registers assignments and reports assignment progress to PrimeNet for the GpuOwl, CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS programs. Supports both Python 2 and 3 and Windows, macOS and Linux. Requires the [Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which is included with most Python 3 installations. The script will automatically install Requests on first run if it is not already installed. GIMPS [discontinued first time LL assignments](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=26682) in April 2021, although the script [still supports them](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=575260#post575260) for users of CUDALucas or with limited disk space. Our [GpuOwl](#gpuowl), [CUDALucas](#cudalucas) and [Mlucas](#mlucas) Linux scripts automatically download, setup and run this. Adapted from the PrimeNet Python script from [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download2) by [Lo√Øc Le Loarer](https://github.com/llloic11/primenet) and Ernst W. Mayer, which itself was adapted from primetools by [Mark Rose](https://github.com/MarkRose/primetools) and [teknohog](https://github.com/teknohog/primetools).

#### Usage

```
Usage: primenet.py [options]

This program will automatically get assignments, report assignment results,
upload proof files and optionally register assignments and report assignment
progress to PrimeNet for the GpuOwl, CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS programs. It
also saves its configuration to a ‚Äúlocal.ini‚Äù file by default, so it is only
necessary to give most of the arguments once. The first time it is run, if a
password is NOT provided, it will register the current GpuOwl/CUDALucas/Mlucas
instance with PrimeNet (see the Registering Options below). Then, it will
report assignment results, get assignments and upload any proof files to
PrimeNet on the --timeout interval, or only once if --timeout is 0. If
registered, it will additionally report the progress on the --checkin
interval.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  --force-pminus1=TESTS_SAVED
                        Force P-1 factoring before LL/PRP tests and/or change
                        the default PrimeNet PRP tests_saved value.
  --pminus1-threshold=PM1_MULTIPLIER
                        Retry the P-1 factoring before LL/PRP tests only if
                        the existing P-1 bounds are less than the target
                        bounds (as listed on mersenne.ca) times this

                        automatically enabled for first time PRP assignments
                        when the --worktype option is for a first time LL
                        worktype.
  --no-report-100m      Do not report any prime results for exponents greater
                        than 100 million digits. You must setup another method
                        to notify yourself.
  --checkin=HOURS_BETWEEN_CHECKINS
                        Hours to wait between sending assignment progress and
                        expected completion dates (1-168 hours), Default: 6
                        hours. Requires that the instance is registered with
                        PrimeNet.
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                        Seconds to wait between updates, Default: 3600 seconds
                        (1 hour). Users with slower internet may want to set a
                        larger value to give time for any PRP proof files to
                        upload. Use 0 to update once and exit.
  -s, --status          Output a status report and any expected completion
                        dates for all assignments and exit.
  --upload-proofs       Report assignment results, upload all PRP proofs and
                        exit. Requires PrimeNet User ID.
  --recover-all         Recover all assignments and exit. This will overwrite
                        any existing work files. Requires that the instance is
                        registered with PrimeNet.
  --unreserve=EXPONENT  Unreserve the exponent and exit. Use this only if you
                        are sure you will not be finishing this exponent.
                        Requires that the instance is registered with
                        PrimeNet.
  --unreserve-all       Unreserve all assignments and exit. Quit GIMPS
                        immediately. Requires that the instance is registered
                        with PrimeNet.
  --no-more-work        Prevent the script from getting new assignments and
                        exit. Quit GIMPS after current work completes.
  --ping                Ping the PrimeNet server, show version information and
                        exit.

  Registering Options:
    Sent to PrimeNet/GIMPS when registering. It will automatically send
    the progress, which allows the program to then be monitored on the
    GIMPS website CPUs page (https://www.mersenne.org/cpus/), just like
    with Prime95/MPrime. This also allows the program to get much smaller
    Category 0 and 1 exponents, if it meets the other requirements
    (https://www.mersenne.org/thresholds/).
