## Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)

üÜï Thanks to Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Colab) service, anyone with an internet connection can now contribute to GIMPS for üÜì, without downloading or installing anything! Please see our [google-colab](google-colab) directory for instructions.

### Prime95/MPrime

Downloads, sets up and runs [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/#download). Supports only x86 CPUs.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mprime.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run]
```

To run Prime95 for Stress/Torture Testing, see the [Testing and Benchmarking](https://github.com/tdulcet/Testing-and-Benchmarking-Scripts) scripts.

### CUDALucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [CUDALucas](https://sourceforge.net/p/cudalucas/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/cudalucas.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run]
```

### Mlucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments. Supports x86 Intel and AMD and ARM CPUs, but only recommended for ARM CPUs, which [Prime95/MPrime](#prime95mprime) does not support. Prime95/MPrime is faster than Mlucas on x86 CPUs. Run: `wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Linux-System-Information/master/info.sh -qO - | bash -s` to output your system information, including CPU and architecture.
This script follows the recommended instructions on the [Mlucas README](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html) for each architecture and CPU.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mlucas.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run]
```

### PrimeNet

Automatically gets assignments, reports assignment results and optionally progress to PrimeNet for both the CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS programs. Supports both Python 2 and 3 and Windows, macOS and Linux. Our [CUDALucas](#cudalucas) and [Mlucas](#mlucas) Linux scripts automatically download, setup and run this. Adapted from the PrimeNet Python script from [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download) by Lo√Øc Le Loarer and Ernst W. Mayer.

#### Usage

```
Usage: primenet.py [options]

This program will automatically get assignments, report assignment results and
optionally progress to PrimeNet for both the CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS
programs. It also saves its configuration to a ‚Äúlocal.ini‚Äù file, so it is only
necessary to give most of the arguments the first time it is run. The first
time it is run, if a password is NOT provided, it will register the current
CUDALucas/Mlucas instance with PrimeNet (see below). Then, it will get
assignments, report the results and progress, if registered, to PrimeNet on a
‚Äútimeout‚Äù interval, or only once if timeout is 0.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Display debugging info
  -w WORKDIR, --workdir=WORKDIR
                        Working directory with ‚Äúworktodo.ini‚Äù and
                        ‚Äúresults.txt‚Äù from the GIMPS program, and ‚Äúlocal.ini‚Äù
                        from this program, Default: . (current directory)
  -i WORKFILE, --workfile=WORKFILE
                        WorkFile filename, Default: ‚Äúworktodo.ini‚Äù
  -r RESULTSFILE, --resultsfile=RESULTSFILE
                        ResultsFile filename, Default: ‚Äúresults.txt‚Äù
  -l LOCALFILE, --localfile=LOCALFILE
                        Local configuration file filename, Default:

  -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
                        GIMPS/PrimeNet User ID. Create a GIMPS/PrimeNet
                        account: https://www.mersenne.org/update/. If you do
                        not want a PrimeNet account, you can use ANONYMOUS.
  -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        GIMPS/PrimeNet Password. Only provide if you want to
                        do manual testing and not report the progress (not
                        recommend). This was the default behavior for old
                        versions of this script.
  -T WORKTYPE, --worktype=WORKTYPE
                        Type of work, Default: 100, 100 (smallest available
                        first-time LL), 101 (double-check LL), 102 (world-
                        record-sized first-time LL), 104 (100M digit number to
                        LL test - not recommended), 150 (smallest available
                        first-time PRP), 151 (double-check PRP), 152 (world-
                        record-sized first-time PRP), 153 (100M digit number
                        to PRP test)
  -g GPU, --gpu=GPU     Get assignments for a GPU (CUDALucas) instead of the
                        CPU (Mlucas). This flag takes as argument your
                        CUDALucas output file.
  -c CPU, --cpu_num=CPU
                        CPU core or GPU number to get assignments for,
                        Default: 0
  -n NUM_CACHE, --num_cache=NUM_CACHE
                        Number of assignments to cache, Default: 0
  -L DAYS_WORK, --days_work=DAYS_WORK
                        Days of work to queue, Default: 3 days. Add one to
                        num_cache when the time left for the current
                        assignment is less then this number of days.
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                        Seconds to wait between network updates, Default:
                        21600 seconds (6 hours). Use 0 for a single update
                        without looping.
  --unreserve_all       Unreserve all assignments and exit. Requires that the
                        instance is registered with PrimeNet.

  Registering Options: sent to PrimeNet/GIMPS when registering. The progress will automatically be sent and the program can then be monitored on the GIMPS website CPUs page (https://www.mersenne.org/cpus/), just like with Prime95/MPrime. This also allows for the program to get much smaller Category 0 and 1 exponents, if it meets the other requirements (https://www.mersenne.org/thresholds/).:
    -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                        Computer name, Default: example
    --cpu_model=CPU_MODEL
                        Processor (CPU) model, Default: cpu.unknown
    --features=FEATURES
                        CPU features, Default: ''
    --frequency=FREQUENCY
                        CPU frequency (MHz), Default: 1000 MHz
    -m MEMORY, --memory=MEMORY
                        Total memory (RAM) (MiB), Default: 0 MiB
    --L1=L1             L1 Cache size (KiB), Default: 8 KiB
    --L2=L2             L2 Cache size (KiB), Default: 512 KiB
    --np=NP             Number of CPU Cores, Default: 1
    --hp=HP             Number of CPU threads per core (0 is unknown),
                        Default: 0
```

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Ideas for contributions:

PrimeNet script:
* Support more GIMPS programs.
* Support reserving exponents in a range (#4) or a specific exponent.
* Support setting more of the program options.
* Support different work types on different CPU cores or GPUs
* Improve the error handling of PrimeNet API calls.
* Automatically detect more system information using code from [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil), so users do not have to manually determine and specify it.
* Improve the performance.
* Add an option to send the user an e-mail/text message if there is an error or if the GIMPS program has not made any progress in a while, using the [Send Msg CLI/SendPy](https://github.com/tdulcet/Send-Msg-CLI).
* Work with GIMPS to support using CUDALucas in the application version string.
	* Currently it only supports Mlucas v19.

General:
* Create script for the [GpuOwl](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl) GIMPS program
* Add options for setting the maximum CPU time
* Update CUDALucas to support PRP tests
* Create a [Tensor Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit) (TPU) GIMPS program (#3)

Thanks to [Daniel Connelly](https://github.com/Danc2050) for updating the PrimeNet Python script from Mlucas to eliminate the password requirement by getting assignments using the [PrimNet API](http://v5.mersenne.org/v5design/v5webAPI_0.97.html) and to support reporting the assignment results and progress for CUDALucas using the PrimNet API, for porting the Prime95 script to Python and for helping create and test the Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks!
