# Google Colabatory and GIMPS
Google offers a service known as [Colabatory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) (Colab), which allows anyone with an internet connection free access to a high-performance GPU and CPU-powered [Jupyter Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook).
This service can be used to run Distributed Computing projects such as the [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://www.mersenne.org/) (GIMPS) for free.
GIMPS can be run on an Nvidia GPU using the [CUDALucas](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cudalucas/) program or a CPU using the [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) program.

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks, a ‚ÄúCPU‚Äù notebook and a ‚ÄúGPU and CPU‚Äù notebook. The ‚ÄúCPU‚Äù notebook runs `Prime95`, while the ‚ÄúGPU and CPU‚Äù notebook runs both `CUDALucas` and `Prime95` since they can run in parallel to ‚Äúcrunch‚Äù more prime numbers.
Each notebook makes use of Google Drive storage, which is provided to all Google accounts.

## How to Use
**Please Note:** you must keep each notebook **OPEN** in your browser to prevent it from disconnecting due to being perceived as idle.

1. **Choose a Persistent Storage Option** Recommend Method: Copy the source of our respective [‚ÄúGPU and CPU‚Äù notebook](GoogleColabGPU.ipynb) and/or [‚ÄúCPU‚Äù notebook](GoogleColabCPU.ipynb), pasting each one into one or more [new notebooks](http://colab.research.google.com/#create=true) in Colab and then uniquely naming and saving the notebook(s) (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>). Next, on the far left, click ‚ÄúüìÅ‚Äù, the ‚ÄúMount Drive‚Äù button and select ‚ÄúCONNECT TO GOOGLE DRIVE‚Äù. Your Drive storage should automatically remount each time you run the notebook(s). Optionally, see the official [video](https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/EQbtltjVAAA2qTs.mp4) for a walkthrough.

    <summary>Alternative Method</summary>
    Open ‚ÄúGPU and CPU‚Äù notebook: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/blob/master/google-colab/GoogleColabGPU.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="GPU-CPU-Notebook"></a> and/or the ‚ÄúCPU‚Äù notebook: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/blob/master/google-colab/GoogleColabCPU.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="CPU-Notebook"></a> in Colab. Then save a copy to your Drive (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>) to avoid a warning each time you run the notebook. *WARNINGS*: This method will continually require an authorization step each time you connect to the notebook(s). When authorizing, follow the link Google provides to authorize the login to your Drive and copy-and-paste the authorization string into the textbox Google provides within the notebook's output box.

2. **If Running the GPU** notebook, you must enable the GPU runtime. On the upper left, click Runtime ‚Üí Change Runtime Type ‚Üí Hardware accelerator ‚Üí GPU ‚Üí SAVE.

3. **Click** ‚Äú‚ñ∂‚Äù to run the GIMPS project anonymously. Alternatively, fill in the fields with your GIMPS/PrimeNet account user credentials.

4. **When the Notebook Disconnects** ‚Äì for example due to its [12-hour](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#idle-timeouts)
usage limit, a bad internet connection, Google requiring your GPU type, etc. ‚Äì follow step 3 again to continue where you left off.

Google may offer you two GPU runtimes to disperse among two of your notebooks. In this case, you may run another GPU job by re-running the steps with a different `computer_number` option. For example, choose `2` if you are already running a notebook with the `Default (1)` number.

## Optional
A user may optionally perform other steps to gain more insight into GIMPS and/or this software:

1. Create a GIMPS/PrimeNet account [here](https://www.mersenne.org/update/) and [join](https://www.mersenne.org/jteam/) the ‚ÄúPortland State University‚Äù team!

2. Set the `debug` option to view the output of a respective GIMPS program. Alternatively, you may access the `gpu1.out`, `gpu2.out`, `cpu1.out`‚Ä¶`cpuN.out`, and `nohup.out` files in your Google Drive under the `GIMPS` and `cudalucas` or `mprime_gpu`/`mprime_cpu` folders to manually see the full CUDALucas and/or Prime95 output respectively.

3. [Pin the tab(s)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pinned-tabs-keep-favorite-websites-open) or move them to a dedicated window for easy access to the Colab notebook(s).

## Required Tools, Restrictions
Anyone with an internet connection and a free Google/Gmail account with [~50 MiB of free space](https://www.google.com/settings/storage) on Google Drive can use both our notebooks to ‚Äúcrunch‚Äù primes.

Please note, though the [resource limits](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#resource-limits) are at times variable, generally the free version of Colab imposes a 12-hour usage limit per notebook. (This usage limit, the GPU runtime limit, and other usage limits are modified if one purchases a [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/) plan.)
Additionally, a user may only assign a GPU runtime to two notebooks at a time whereas one may run an unknown upper-bound of notebooks with the CPU runtime enabled.

## GPUs Offered
Google Colab runs exclusively on Nvidia GPUs where the model assigned to you depends on availability.
The most [powerful GPU](https://www.mersenne.ca/cudalucas.php) currently offered is the `Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB`.

Some other possible GPUs that may be assigned are listed below for reference:

```
Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB
Tesla K80
Tesla T4
Tesla P4
```
See the [gpu_optimizations](gpu_optimizations) directory for more information about each GPU.

Though each GPU works well and will complete most assignments in a matter of days, one may use the following method to attain a new GPU:
`Runtime ‚Üí Factory reset runtime ‚Üí YES`. After repeating 1-3 times, Google will usually assign a new GPU.

## Acknowledgements
We acknowledge the following projects, which enabled and encouraged us to create these notebooks:
* [Our Bash scripts](/../../#organizations), which automatically download, build and setup the respective GIMPS programs on Colab.
* [Our PrimeNet Python script](/../../#primenet), which automatically gets assignments, reports assignment results and progress for CUDALucas using the PrimNet API.
* The [GPU72 notebook](https://github.com/chalsall/GPU72_CoLab), whose work encouraged us to also use the [form](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/forms.ipynb) format.
* The [Linux System Information script](https://github.com/tdulcet/Linux-System-Information), which outputs the system information for the Colab VM.
